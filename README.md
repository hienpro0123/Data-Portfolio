## About This Portfolio Template

This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my skills in:
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Data modeling and analysis
- Creating interactive, professional dashboards
- Transforming complex data into actionable insights

I am a third-year Data Science student with hands-on experience building end-to-end analytics and ETL pipelines using SQL, Python, Apache Airflow, and Power BI.

## 🚀 Projects

This template is set up to showcase my best work. You can see the project cards on the live website and in the `index.html` file.

### Retail Sales & Product Performance Dashboard
Analyzed thousands of pizza sales transactions using SQL Server to explore revenue by time, store, and product type.  
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to highlight top/bottom performers, revenue trends, and ordering patterns to support data-driven decisions.

### Shopping Mall Customer Analytics
Cleaned and prepared 500+ shopping-mall transactions (demographics, categories, spending, dates) with Python (Pandas).  
Loaded the data into SQL Server and designed a Power BI report to explore customer behavior by age group, gender, category, payment method, and mall location.

### TopCV Job Market ETL Pipeline
Developed an ETL pipeline that scrapes Data Analyst job postings from TopCV using Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup).  
Cleaned salary and location fields, loaded the data into a SQL database, and prepared it for further analysis and dashboarding to understand trends in job requirements and salaries.
